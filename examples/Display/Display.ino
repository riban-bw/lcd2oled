  lcd2olde Library - display() and noDisplay()

 Demonstrates the use a 128x64 pixel (21x8 character) OLED display.  The lcd2oled
 library works with OLED displays that are compatible with the
 Solomon SysTech SDD1306 driver.

 This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD and uses the
 display() and noDisplay() functions to turn on and off
 the display.

  The circuit:
 * OLED RES# pin to digital pin 12
 * OLED D0 to SLCK
 * OLED D1 to SDA
 * OLED D/C# pin to ground
 * OLED CS# pin to ground

 This example code is derived from LiquidCrystal example code and in the public domain.
