  lcd2olde Library -  Serial Input

 Demonstrates the use a 128x64 pixel (21x8 character) OLED display.  The lcd2oled
 library works with OLED displays that are compatible with the
 Solomon SysTech SDD1306 driver.

 This sketch displays text sent over the serial port
 (e.g. from the Serial Monitor) on an attached LCD.

  The circuit:
 * OLED RES# pin to digital pin 12
 * OLED D0 to SLCK
 * OLED D1 to SDA
 * OLED D/C# pin to ground
 * OLED CS# pin to ground

 This example code is derived from LiquidCrystal example code and in the public domain.

// include the library code:
#include <lcd2oled.h>

// Initialise the library with the numbers of the interface pins
lcd2oled lcd(12);

void setup() {
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  // initialize the serial communications:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
  // when characters arrive over the serial port...
  if (Serial.available()) {
    // wait a bit for the entire message to arrive
    delay(100);
    // clear the screen
    lcd.clear();
    // read all the available characters
    while (Serial.available() > 0) {
      // display each character to the LCD
      lcd.write(Serial.read());
    }
